Restarting Development
I have good news for everybody interested in this project! In the past few months we somehow spent a lot of time on this game and did a great many steps toward version 1.1!

Among the improvements we have

- A complete rebalance of the game making Easy modo more casual as well as
  Lunatic less unfair.
- Many graphical improvements (Stage backgrounds, Dialog graphics, FX)
- Challenging Extra Spells you can unlock for every boss.
