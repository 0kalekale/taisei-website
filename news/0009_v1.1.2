Taisei v1.1.2 Released!
This is a maintenance release of the stable v1.1 branch. It doesn't have any gameplay changes, and consists entirely of bugfixes and improvements backported from the v1.2 development tree.

Replays recorded with v1.1 and v1.1.1 should be fully compatible with this version, and vice versa.

Some of the notable changes are:

- Fixed sound not working with SDL_mixer 2.0.2 due to incorrect initialization
  order.

- Made all audio resources optional. Taisei will no longer abort when trying to
  load music or a sound effect when the audio subsystem has failed to initialize
  or was disabled at build time.

- Fixed various issues related to fullscreen and window management.

- Implemented a more robust way to choose an appropriate SDL video driver. The
`TAISEI_VIDEO_DRIVER` environment variable is now deprecated. See
[here](https://github.com/taisei-project/taisei/blob/v1.1.2/ENVIRON.md#video-and-opengl)
for details.

- On Windows systems with hybrid graphics (typically laptops), Taisei will now
  attempt to use the more powerful discrete GPU by default.

- Fixed a linking error that occured for dynamically linked Windows builds. The
  official releases for Windows are still statically linked, however.
